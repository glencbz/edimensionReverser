###It reverses the course list 

###Ignoring
You can edit the script to put some courses at the bottom. Enter the search term in apostrophes like below
```
//THESE ARE THE COURSES YOU WANT TO END UP AT THE BOTTOM
//********************************************
var ignore =[
	"survey",
	"capstone"
];
//********************************************
```

###Ignoring
Works just like ignoring, except that it highlights the courses you want in a somewhat pleasing shade of blue.
```
//THESE ARE THE COURSES YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT
//********************************************
var highlightCourses = [
	"optimization",
	"machine",
	"database",
	"the mind",
];
//********************************************
```
